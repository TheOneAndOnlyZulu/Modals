# About Super Simple Modals

Super Simple Modals is a small Vanilla JavaScript library that does what it says on the tin. Allow you to create pop-up modals on your website in no time, with a tiny amount of code.

## Objectives

This package aims to be:

- Fully accessible: Complying to the latest <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG guidelines</a>, to AAA standard.
- Lightweight: We known webiste load times are key, not only to the ranking of your site, but the user experience. Our package will always remain as small as possible, & never weigh you down.
- Contain minimilistic styling: Make it look how you want without adding `!important` to every line of you css. Overriding styling should be a doddle, though we will give you a guiding hand with examples.
